# ZX Spectrum Emulator

This is a simple ZX Spectrum emulator written in Python.

The project is based on the [Ut-88 / Radio-RK86 emulator](https://github.com/grafalex82/ut88) developed earlier. Both emulators share similar design concepts and emulation principles. There is no goal in 1-to-1 emulation of the hardware. The focus rather is on getting emulation working, understanding ZX Spectrum architecture, hardware design and software.
